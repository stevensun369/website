## Description

This is a game where you have to solve different puzzles, but I will refer to them as modules, in order to successfully defuse the bomb. Failing to do so will result in the "detonation" of the bomb and failing the game.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project came from my passion for gaming and technology. I wanted to blend these two in one place and create something that can be used in a fun and relaxing way.

## Hardware

The STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q acts as the high-performance "brain" managing the game logic and countdown, while the TM1637 Display provides the visual timer and the DHT11 Sensor handles the interactive heat-defusal module. User inputs are captured via Square Buttons and a Green LED signals successful module completion, with an Active Buzzer providing audible strikes or explosion alerts. Finally, the SN74LS21DR AND Gate and SN74LS04N NOT Gate provide a hard-wired physical logic layer for the wire-cutting module, ensuring the circuit is only validated when the specific "correct" wire is disconnected.
